While growing up I spent alot of time learning game development. I've never really put these skills to use since I settled as a web developer and I don't intend this to change anytime soon. For an interesting JavaScript challenge I have decided to recreate the old asteroids arcade game using HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Requirments

- The player should be able to rotate left & right, and move forward.

## Result

After a few days of work this is where I found myself:

_Please not that this demo does not work on mobile as it relies on keyboard support._

Use the `←` and `→` to rotate the ship; `↑` to move forward and; `␣` to fire.
