So JAM stack is all the rage right now 'huh'. If you don't know what it is yet don't worry. It's really just a static site with some javascript (**J**avascript **A**nd **M**arkup). The really important part is the tooling. You don't want to be building these static pages by hand. This is where Gatsby comes in. It's role is a static site generator that uses React and GraphQL to allow you to make blindingly fast pages with ease.

When it comes to web development I'd say that I'm proficient when it comes to building web app. The problem is that a static site is not really a web app. It needs to load fast and sell whatever it's meant to sell, well. Because of this I've decided to give it a go and build this blog, not only to give Gatsby a go but also to give me a place to document more of my side projects in the future.
